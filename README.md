# VELHO Warehouse Management #
A software engineering project developed by a group of 2nd year students (Edward Puustinen, Joona Silvennoinen & me) of Metropolia University of Applied Sciences during 2016-01-19â€”2016-05-15.
The goals of the project were to practice:
* agile software development using the Scrum framework (we also acted as product owners),
* project management,
* the [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) branching model,
* unit testing,
* internationalization and localization of an existing software product,
* and improving the usability of an existing user interface.

In the first 8 weeks of the project we developed a warehouse management system from scratch for tracking warehouse inventory with searching features, basic user accounts, and logging.
In the last 8 weeks we implemented the following new features:
* German localization with dynamic translation switching,
* various user interface usability improvements,
* in situ editing of data in tables to eliminate the need for a database administrator to use the product,
* comma-separated value (CSV) file import and export for mass data transfer,
* and replaced direct SQL queries with the Hibernate ORM framework.
